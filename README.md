# Portfolio-Projects
Varied projects to show off current skills with HTML, CSS and Javascript
THIS SITE WAS CREATED TO TEST MY SKILLS WITHOUT TUTORIAL SUPPORT TO GAGE MY HTML AND CSS SKILLS ALONG WITH MY INTEREST IN UX/UI DESIGN. 
I HAVE A PASSION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION AND ENJOY LEARNING ABOUT ELON MUSK AND HIS ADVENTAGEOUS ENDEAVOURS TO LEAD THE WAY INTO MODERN SPACE EXPLORATION WITH VISIONARY IDEAS AND BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURAL AND MECHANICAL ARCHITECTURE. 
THIS SITE WAS AN HOMAGE TO SPACE EXPLORATION WITH A NOD TO ELON MUSK'S SPACE X.
